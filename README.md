# Command line tool

## Installation
```
pip install bintang-buddy
```

## Usage
The steps are straightforward and very human.

Try running the commands below:
```
bintang-buddy -d "2022-01-13" -g "milpitas" -g "sunnyvale"
```

This script has two arguments:
1. `-d`: Date string, in the form of `YYYY-MM-DD`
2. `-g`: The names of the gyms you'd like to load court schedules for. If you leave this empty you'll get every court for every gym, and you'll be waiting for a while. Your choices: `campbell, dublin, milpitas, san carlos, sunnyvale`.


# Credits
This is a fork of [teoh/bintang-buddy](https://github.com/teoh/bintang-buddy) which provided a lot of the base functionality (kudos!). However,
- [teoh/bintang-buddy](https://github.com/teoh/bintang-buddy) required users to clone the repository, create a virtual environment, activate it, install the project inside the virtual environment, obtain a Bearer token, set an environment variable with the Bearer token and run a Python script.
- This process was quite involved even for a moderately technical person. 

This fork, however:
- Creates an easy-to-use CLI based on [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) which is published to `pypi`. The CLI can be installed through a single command and is ready to go.
- Removes the need to manually (and painstakingly) obtain a `Bearer` token for authentication (as described [here](https://github.com/teoh/bintang-buddy#getting-the-bearer-token)). This is now done automatically behind the scenes.
- Uses multithreading to significantly reduce load times.
- Uses linting and formatting tools to keep code clean and organized.
- The goal is to eventually merge changes from this repository back into [teoh/bintang-buddy](https://github.com/teoh/bintang-buddy).
